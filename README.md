Abstract: One Health approach is a catalyst for sustainable development and seeks to address societal challenges, animal health challenges and environmental challenges at global and other levels. Denitrification is a major component of the nitrogen cycle that affects humans, animals, plants, and the environment. The complex biogeochemical four-step denitrification is a microbial strain-level ecological trait and the denitrification potential (functional performance) can be inferred from trait rules that rely on the presence or absence of genes for denitrifying enzymes in microbial genomes. Web portals for microbial genomes provide large-scale taxonomic-strain level datasets that include annotation of enzymes encoded by microbial genomes. Thus, a goal of our microbial denitrification data investigations is to advance the knowledge and understanding of biochemical, molecular and physiological aspects of microbial denitrification. We report the construction of a denitrification potential dataset of 62,624 microbial genomes (866 archaea and 61,758 bacteria) that encode at least one of the 12 denitrifying enzymes in the four-step canonical denitrification pathway. We used a 4-digit binary-coding scheme to categorize the microbial genomes to one of 16 denitrification traits including complete denitrification trait assigned to 3,280 genomes from 260 bacteria genera. The bacterial strains with complete denitrification potential genomes were isolated or detected in diverse ecosystems including the filter-feeding marine Eastern oyster. The microbial denitrification potential dataset and accompanying interactive data investigations resources can contribute to strengthening One Health scientific evidence base and other data-driven actions for optimizing health of ecosystems. Based on our findings on multiple denitrification traits and association with One Health components, we recommend Arcobacteraceae, a Gram-negative bacteria family in the phylum Campylobacterota, as a use case for Digital One Health framework to microbial denitrification. Overall, our data investigations contributes to the One Health High-Level Panel (OHHLEP) high-level actions in the Theory of Change pathway on data, evidence, education, and knowledge exchange.
